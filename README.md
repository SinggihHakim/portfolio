## 📖 Overview

This portfolio is built with a focus on clean design and user experience. It features a dark mode toggle, smooth scrolling navigation, and a contact form section. The layout is optimized for all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Dark Mode Support:** Includes a toggle switch to switch between light and dark themes for better readability.
* **Smooth Navigation:** Features a sticky navbar with smooth scrolling to different sections (Home, About, Portfolio, Clients, Blog, Contact).
* **Project Showcase:** A dedicated section to display my latest projects with descriptions and images.
* **Contact Form:** A functional layout for users to get in touch (requires backend integration for email sending).
* **Interactive UI:** subtle animations and hover effects enhance the user experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure of the website.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Handles interactivity, such as the hamburger menu, sticky navbar, and dark mode logic.
